Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software development is aimed to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
create high-quality- Software is easy to learn, efficient to use, and pleasant in its interactions.
reliable-software System performs its required functions under a specified period.
maintainable software- This indicates how easily software can be modified to correct faults, improve performance.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - gathering requirements from cliant,or business.
Design-System design serves as a guidline for the development team to follow.
Implementation- development team writes the code based on the required in the system design phase.
Testing-To verify that the software functions according to the specified requirements.
Deployment-releasing the software for production use.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Agile methodology places emphasis on flexible, iterative progress by the project into more manageable units of work.
changes help developers spend less time implementing extraneous functionality.

The waterfall model is a rigid, highly structured approach that requires permission of the project to be defined before any work can begin.
Fix bugs identified in production, this may take a long time due to slow speed of Waterfall development


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer role and Responsibilities Software Developer
Writing and Testing Code: Writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code according to specifications. They also conduct thorough testing to identify and errors.
Resolving issues that arise during development and testing.
improving existing features or refactoring code to increase performance..




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

importance of Integrated Development Environments- keeping developers up to date with the latest best practices and threats, and standardizing the development process so that everyone can get on board.
provide many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software.
importance of Version Control Systems- practice in software engineering that involves tracking and managing changes to software code. It allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Lack of Workflow Visibility- Prepare your team to be highly resilient and respond to all sorts of challenges. 
Broken SDLC Processes- Removing those persistent SDLC blockers by inspecting, detecting, and fixing the root cause.
Lack of Predictability In Software Delivery- Track software delivery metrics to understand your delivery status, and visualize how each variable can impact your delivery timelines. 
The Problems With Development Velocity- Early detection and fixing of bugs saves time and effort later.
Scalability, Security, and Performance Challenges- Adhere to compliances & regulations for better security

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit
Unit testing is a software testing process for testing specific software elements. Testing is to check each unit of code performance. 
integration
integration testing, is when different software components and modules are combined and tested as multiple programmers to make sure everything is ready for the phase. This level is referred to thread testing.
System
The next level of software testing is system testing. This checks for a system’s compliance in accordance with the standard given requirements. System testing check components like performance, load, reliability, and security with the goal.
Acceptance
Final testing conducted by the user since the goal is to find out if the requirements have been met on the final product. Since acceptance testing is the final phase, it needs to check for things like cosmetic errors, spelling mistakes, and usability.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompts play a important role in serving as a interaction between machine and human. 
AI prompt engineering ensuring the artificial intelligence responds in a clear and understandable way


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

“Tell me about games”
“Tell me about indigenous games”
Ensuring artificial intelligence responds in a clear and understandable way.
